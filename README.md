# Least-Square-Fit
Given numeric data points, find an equation that approximates the data with a least square fit. This is one of many techniques for getting an analytical approximation to numeric data.
The problem is stated as follows :
   Given measured data for values of Y based on values of X1,X2 and X3. e.g.

  Find a, b and c such that   Y_approximate =  a * X1 + b * X2 + c * X3
  and such that the sum of (Y_actual - Y_approximate) squared is minimized.
  (We are minimizing RMS error.)
